## 2025-02-28 - [Accessible Console Legends]
**Learning:** Console UI status legends that rely purely on color names (e.g., `Green/Yel/Red`) are an accessibility failure for colorblind users and screen readers.
**Action:** Always use explicit text tags (e.g., `[ OK ] / [WARN] / [CRIT]`) alongside colors to convey status meaning in CLI applications.
