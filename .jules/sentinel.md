## 2026-01-19 - Log Injection Risk in Serial Telemetry
**Vulnerability:** Telemetry inputs from serial ports were logged directly upon parsing failure without sanitization, allowing for Log Injection (Log Forging).
**Learning:** Even internal or hardware-based inputs (like serial ports) should be treated as untrusted, especially when data integrity is critical.
**Prevention:** Sanitize all inputs before logging, specifically removing or escaping newline characters.
